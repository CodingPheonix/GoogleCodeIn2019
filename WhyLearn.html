<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
    Ever since I could hold a pencil, I have always been fasinated with colors, drawing, and sketching. My imagination was rabid, everywhere I went I saw faces and people. Clouds became paintings, trees became creatures moving silently in the wind, unnoticed, rocks a masterpiece of the earth. Nature around me became the canvas for my mind to feast on. I soon learned to doodle everything that I saw down, in my books. Everywhere I went I doodled, in classrooms, at home, even on my exam papers! Soon it became as natural as breathing, and my prefered way of expression.
