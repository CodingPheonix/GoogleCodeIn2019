The reason why Python is slower than Numpy, is due to it's specialisation in dealing with matricies and 2D arrays. It's built to process data quickly  and efficiently as it is a library that focuses on data manipulation. Wherever there is a for loop in Python, numpy has a specialised function for initialising these matricies. Processing in Numpy is vectorised whereas vanilla Python is designed to be more versatile to be able to do more than just data processing like Numpy is. When we run a for loop in Python, looping over an array and repeating mathematical operations several times, in Numpy that happens instantly. My evidence for this claim is in my data: graph.png.
