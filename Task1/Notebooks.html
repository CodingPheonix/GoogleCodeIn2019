    <h1>Choosing a notebook</h1>

    <h2>My notebook:</h2>
    <p>
      In my experience, any paper will do, as it does not make much difference when you are at a developing stage in your art. At a professional level of course some artists have there perferences in terms paper i.e. thickness, texture, and color. I encourage begininners to simply doodle on anything and everything, from newpapers to school notebooks or even a toiletpaper!
